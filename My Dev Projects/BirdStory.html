        Once upon a time, there was a little bird named <i>Sally</i>. She was
        always very sad and no one knew why. She would often feel
        <b>left out</b> and <b>depressed</b> and no ne could help her. One day 
        she said to mommy bird:

                I wish there was some way to cure me. To free myself
                from misery. Everything I do and try never works out.
                Where am I meant to be?

        Her mom became very worried about her. She thought she might make
        a bad decision. When her dad came home from fetching worms, Sally
        was very happy. But her dad knew something was wrong with her

        On a bright sunny day, Sally went out to fly. One of her favorite things was
        basking herself in the warm sun. The more she kept flying, the more
        alive she felt and all the sudden <i>things weren't so bad</i>. All the sudden
        though, it started to rain hard. So hard that it broke one of her wings.
        She tried her best to get home but the rain was too strong. Eventually, all her muscles
        gave out and she fell. From tremendous heights to the gound. She realized that She
        will never be in the sun again or talk to her parents. <u>her misery wasn't so bad- she just had
            to look at the love around you</u>
